	<h2>System Introduction</h2>
	<img src="https://howardcounty.librarycalendar.com/sites/default/files/Howard%20County%20Public%20Library%20Logo_0.png" title="HCPL Logo" alt="HCPL Logo" style="width:210px;height:60px;"/>
	<h3>Context</h3>
	<p>The <a href="https://hclibrary.org/">Howard County Library System</a> (HCLS) is a public library system that serves the residents of Howard County, MD. The library system was established in 1940 and includes 6 different branches. The <a href="https://hclibrary.org/about-us/mission-and-vision/">mission</a> is to be the place for the community "to learn, grow, and connect.”</p>
	<h3>Users</h3>
	<p>HCLS serves a wide audience of community members. Some examples are students, teachers, parents, and general community members seeking access to resources.</p>
	<h3>Content</h3>
	<p>HCLS has an extensive collection available for its community which consists of over 1 million physical and digital resources. Resources available consists of:
	<ul>
	<li>Physical books, ebooks, and audiobooks</li>
	<li>Audiovisual media like DVDs, CDs, and access to streaming services</li>
	<li>Access to databases and research tools</li>
	<li>Access to information on educational events and resources like tutoring support</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Discussion on the System</h2>
	<h3>Interesting Features</h3>
	<p>The system is a pretty basic library system. However, some interesting features include the search bar up top with the ability to search just the catalog or the whole website. I also appreciate the 6 “quick links” that include high traffic topics like wireless printing, today’s classes, and ebooks and audiobooks. They also include several lists that can be used to explore different book titles.</p>
	<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
	<p>Pros</p>
	<ul>
	<li>HCPL has many resources available for the community through its website</li>
	<li>Functional mobile view</li>
	<li>Decent search capabilities</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Cons</P>
	<ul>
	<li>Website can be overwhelmingly initially</li>
	<li>Could promote more engagement with the user by including reviews, ratings, etc</li>
	<li>Has a slightly outdated look and feel</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Suggestions for Improvement</h3>
	<p>I would recommend that HCPL does a website refresh that focuses on modernizing the visual look and enhancing overall usability. A more current look and feel can improve first impressions of the library site and encourage greater engagement from users. Besides aesthetics, it’s important to prioritize the site’s organization. As many pages are currently hard to find or can be overwhelming, HCPL should focus on simplifying and consolidating pages which will make the site more accessible and easier to use. </p>
